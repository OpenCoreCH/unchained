2. Configurable only through process.env
3. No DB attached to logger
4. No log-module available anymore (no Logs.find, etc.)

2. move EventDirector out of core-events _emit_, _setEmitAdapter_, _registerEvents_, _setEmitHistoryAdapter_ (core-events) 
3. Core-events uses db to track events

CORE-EVENTS (DONE)
1. Use _setEmitHistoryAdapter_ to create a default History adapter that writes to the database.

INTETRAGION (DONE)
1. User Logger and Events in core and api packages


OPEN QUESTIONS FOR PASCAL
1. Logs in DB incl. any information in the API is removed. Correct?
2. Should the setEmitHistoryAdapter be public and overwriteable?
3. _unchained-logger_ and _unchained-events_ are now (public) npm packages. Shall I revert them to atmosphere packages? Do we have a @unchained namespace for those? 
4. No changes for now to reduce async-await. I suggest that is something for another day!?
