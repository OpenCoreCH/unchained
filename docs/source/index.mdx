**Unchained Engine is an open-source API-first e-commerce framework that lets you build your own custom shopping experiences**
 
![diagram](./images/System-Architecture.png)

#### Unchained Engine provides:

- **Codeability**, so you can tweak the system with endless possibilities not restricted by "customization" or a settings-approach
- **GraphQL API**, allowing you to build fast, performant and modern storefronts
- **Stateless architecture**, allowing you to scale horizontally and vertically
- **Production readiness**, due the fact that the host company uses the Unchained Engine for medium- to big enterprise web shops (Dogfooding)
