This tutorial helps you to ...

- Log into your Control Panel
- Fill your store with content using the Control Panel
- Understand the store's data entities
- Use graphQL queries and mutations to feed and search over the Unchained Engine api.

## Step 1: Access Control Panel

In order to add content to your store, you need to log into the store's control panel.
Navigate to your store domain: https://my-first.unchained.shop

After the initial setup the username and password can be set as following:

**Username**: _local@unchained.shop_<br />
**Password**: _password_
<style>
  .warning {
    color: red;
    font-size: 1rem;
    padding: 1rem;
    border: 1px solid red;
  }
</style>
<p class="warning">This is a test project using common hard-coded credentials. Change your password as soon as you intend to work professionally with the engine.</p>

## Step 2: Add a new Category (Assortment)

## Step 3: Add a new Product 


Those are only the basic steps to fill some products into your store. There is much more you can do in the Control Panel. See the references in the section Further Reading for more information.
